<h4>How commits are affected?</h4>

<p>1.When you open the interactive rebase (git rebase -i <base>), Git shows a list of commits to replay in order.

2.If you change pick â†’ edit on any commit, Git will pause at that commit during the replay.

3.You can only edit the commit you marked edit. All later commits are unaffected until Git replays them.</p>
